1. Rename the file that named "env-EXAMPLE.txt" in the project's folder to ".env" (make sure to be as written, yes I know it looks weird for people using .env files for the first time).
1. Open the project's folder from a terminal window and run the following command `npm run install` to install all the needed dependencies.
1. After installing all the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal: `npm run start` to run the server on http://localhost:3000.
